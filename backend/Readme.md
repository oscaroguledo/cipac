# Getting Started with the project 

This folder section contains the Frontend codes using React JS which are stored in the folder `frontend`


The "backend" folder contains the core django files like ### `settings.py` and `wsgi.py`


The "baseapp" folder is the django app we'll be using

### Thank You 

## Happy Coding!!!
